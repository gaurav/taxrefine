== Requirements ==
* [http://www.perl.org/ Perl 5.10]
* A webserver
** One of the great things about using [http://www.perldancer.org/ Dancer] is the number of [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Dancer::Deployment deployment options] available, including running the script directly as a self-contained web server.
** At the moment, I run Agrew on [http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/Starman Starman] on a local Unix socket, then proxy to that throw nginx on port 80. That way, Starman is never exposed directly on the internet, and both nginx and Starman run in a restricted, web-only account.
* LWP::UserAgent (<tt>libwww-perl</tt>)
* URI (<tt>liburi-perl</tt>)
* JSON (<tt>libjson-perl</tt>)
* [http://search.cpan.org/~yanick/Dancer/ Dancer] (<tt>libdancer-perl</tt>)
* Starman (<tt>starman</tt>)
